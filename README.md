# Sheaf mereology

Draft paper.

The current draft is already dumped into the correct template required 
by the journal.

It can take a very long time to compile the whole thing, so this is 
broken into multiple pieces which all import the same custom definitions.

See (submission-full.pdf)[submission-full.pdf] for the single-file version.

TODO (update as needed):

- [ ] Check all the math/examples.
- [ ] Condense the prose.
- [ ] Check the references.
