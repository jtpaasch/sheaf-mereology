# Sheaf mereology

Draft paper.

The current draft is already dumped into the correct template required by the journal.

The paper is very long, but the approach is: write it all down first, then compress and wordsmith it later.

It takes a very long time to compile the whole thing, so this is broken into multiple pieces which all import the same custom definitions.

TODO (update as needed):

- [ ] Check all the math. 
- [ ] Add new examples of sheaves and modalities if helpful.
- [ ] Flesh out the lit review in the intro.
- [ ] Flesh out the discussion of what mereology looks like in the sheaf-theoretic setting. Right now it is just a bullet list of half-baked thoughts.
- [ ] Flesh out the topos logic sections.
